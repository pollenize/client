            Pollenize is a nonpartisan, apolitical non-profit organization
            seeking to provide voters with the most accurate election
            information possible. We aim to make a positive impact on voter
            turnout and help spark political discussion in communities around

            People talk about how important it is to vote, but the information
            necessary to make a confident decision is often sparse, unclear, and
            riddled with political rhetoric and jargon. Pollenize cuts through
            the noise and bring you the most clear, to-the-point information
            about topics that really matter.

              You&apos;d be forgiven if you can&apos;t remember where each
              [candidate] stands on the big issues. Pollenize is a site that is
              trying to make it easier for voters.

              Sifting through a pool of political information on the internet
              can be overwhelming. But now, there&apos;s an app for that.
