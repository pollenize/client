With the swaths of media attention and constant melee of words between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, it's hard to imagine that their are two other presidential candidates that will be on electoral ballots come Nov 8th. Gary Johnson, Libertarian Presidential Nominee and Jill Stein, Green Party Presidential Nominee have fought hard to get voters attention this election. Yet, without large financial backing or mainstream press coverage on their side, it is an uphill battle. According to rules set by The Commission of Presidential Debates, nether third party candidates are eligible to participate in the debates unless they receive 15 percent support in polling averages. As of Sep 16th, using the average of five national polls, Gary Johnson was polling at 8.4 percent while Stein 3.2 percent. Thus, neither Johnston or Stein have been allowed to participate in the debates.

No third- party candidate has ever won a U.S presidential election. The strongest showing for a third-party candidate came in 1912, when former President Theodore Roosevelt left the Republican Party for the Progressive Party. Roosevelt came in second, with 27.4 percent of the popular vote. More recently, in 1992 Ross Perot running as an independent against Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush took 18.9 percent of the vote.

Why can third party candidates be important? Third party candidates can bring attention to issues that neither of the major parties are discussing, they can also promote concepts and policies that could be important for America's economic, social and political future. However, some feel that no third-party candidate could ever win in the United States, so by voting for them, you are essentially "wasting" your vote. We believe that this should be your choice to decide.
